        <p>On my way back from Ljubljana (Slovenia) to Genova (Italy), I had a 1 hour halt at Milano Lampugnano, a bus stop designated for travellers that use the regional/cross-border buses. I was surprisingly not tired despite an 8 hour bus ride, thanks to the cross-legged posture and Greta Van Fleet while slowly absorbing every perfectly played solo. 15 minutes into my wait, it began getting cold and bought a &lsquo;panino&rsquo; &amp; coffee to warm my body.</p>
<p>I stepped out and saw an empty spot next to a man wearing a red jacket, with a sense of calm on his face and was slowly observing fellow-travelers. I am naturally inclined to approach and speak with those who emit a sense of grace that emerges from inner qualities of calmness, patience, and strength. I approached and asked if the spot next to him was empty, and he responded &ldquo;Siii&rdquo;, and made space for me to enjoy my meal. As soon as I said &ldquo;Grazie&rdquo; he responded with a &ldquo;Niente - Dove va ?&rdquo;. &ldquo;Genova.. e te ?&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Io vado a Germania in Frankurt&rdquo;. I could tell he preferred speaking in English, else he would have replied &ldquo;Francoforte&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I asked where he was from and he said &ldquo;Ghana!&rdquo;, and got into my earlier enquiry of knowing the source of this calmness and his journey. &lsquo;Nurdin&rsquo; had been in Italy since 2013, and was currently working in Germany at a bicycle shop. I asked, in English, &ldquo;What was your journey ? How did you come here ?&rdquo;. He smiled and gave a gasped laugh. &ldquo;Aahh&hellip; long story&rdquo;. I responded, &ldquo;I am a great listener full of patience - please tell me&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With a heavy heart he said how it was a time of his life that when he sometimes thinks of, it scares him. I didn&rsquo;t want to push any further, but he took a deep breath and started a swim through memory lane. Nurdin had lost his father due to a family feud, he was killed by his own people over a quarrel concerning a piece of land (can you imagine ?). I had chills in my spine. Before I explain the story further, let me take a moment to explain this &lsquo;chill&rsquo;. In recent times, because of Yoga (correct pronunciation is &lsquo;Yog&rsquo; - &lsquo;aha&rsquo;, and not &ldquo;YO-GAA&rdquo;) and focusing excessively on educating myself about the scientific investigations of ancient civilisations, that we call &lsquo;Spirituality&rsquo;, you begin to get much calmer and begin interacting with the world on the postulates of truth. You begin to speak clearly, with clarity, and the truth. It teaches you how you must be indifferent to the variations of the Maya, and continue your journey further, with the complete truth. I consoled his heavy heart with a slight sense of guilt that I made him go through these thoughts. Maybe it was the wrong question ? I said &ldquo;I lost my father too Nurdin, in 2020&rdquo;. &ldquo;I am so sorry&rdquo;. &ldquo;No don&rsquo;t be sorry Nurdin, I am very thankful for the breaking points in my life. They are helping me become the person I envision. My only goal now in life is to retire my Mother, at the earliest, and bring back that smile on her face&rdquo;. He had a wide smile giving me the sense that he got the essence of my message and said &ldquo;Very good&rdquo;. &ldquo;But Nurdin, I would like to know more about this journey of yours&rdquo;. &ldquo;Please tell me&rdquo;, and I pushed him. I was curious because I sensed there was something inspirational behind.</p>
<p>Nurdin&rsquo;s mother told him, since he was the only son in the family they will come for him next, and that he must escape Ghana immediately. In the year 2012, he left for Libya just after the civil war had broken out in 2011 - thus the remnants of the chaos were still present. There he came across some people who helped him cross the seas and reach Italy. &ldquo;I am all alone, I am not scared and I don&rsquo;t give up&rdquo;. When the time was right, he got onto a boat to cross the seas, only with the hope to find a better tomorrow. He stopped to rethink and said, &ldquo;The boat was meant for about 45 people, but we were 900. It was an inflatable boat, and some parts of the boat would sink in the water from time to time&rdquo;. I was silenced for a moment, and tried to put myself in his place and couldn&rsquo;t even imagine what it would feel like to be in the laps of ferocious Mother Nature - not knowing whether you will live a moment longer. He swallowed the tension in his throat and continued, &ldquo;But by Gods grace, I survived and arrived to Italy. They took me to a camp in Milan where I stayed for two years. I was then asked to go to the &lsquo;Questura&rsquo;, where I had to tell them my story&rdquo;. I immediately asked, &ldquo;Tell me more about this story, what inspires you to keep going ahead ?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He said he has always been someone who wanted to keep going ahead, push further, and not give up. He wouldn&rsquo;t have seen me there at the bus stop had he not had the will and strength in his heart to push beyond the limits of his mind and body. &ldquo;I earlier worked in a restaurant, and the person working with me always saw that I would get up in the morning and be always out of the house - just trying things out. I am all alone, and I never give up, so I keep trying new things. This man then told me, look I have a shop in Germany, would you like to work there ? I took the opportunity and said yes. Now I am working in my bicycle shop&rdquo;. Nurdin had made it - to share this story with me, and inspire me. From seeing death straight in the eyes, conquering all the limits of the conventional 21st century mind, to now living a respectable and comfortable life. Isn&rsquo;t that a journey to learn and be inspired from ? We get so illusioned in our lives searching for heroes, but fail to recognize it among people around us. My mother is another example, but I will explain that in a separate post.</p>
<p>I asked him if I could click his picture and write a short note about this experience of having met a mighty soul like him, and he said &ldquo;No problem&rdquo;. The bus to Genova was leaving in 10 minutes, and I had to bid him goodbye. I stood up and approached to hug him. He smiled and opened his arms wide open. Such powerful souls have an emanating energy that is rare to find, and when I do, I take every opportunity to learn from their stories. I often get asked &ldquo;Who inspires you Sanket ?&rdquo;. My responses have changed from the societal names such as tech entrepreneurs and billionaires to the &lsquo;Common Man&rsquo;. They have the most to learn from - the person who cleans the street, who works as a security guard, the bus driver, the barista, your teachers, your parents, your ancestors, the police, the judges, the electrician, the plumber, etc. These are people who get up every morning, to serve their role in society, with an undying spirit and continue to circumvent the walls that life constructs right in front of them. They&rsquo;re the ones who deserve our utmost respect - they are heroes without a voice and inspirations without a name.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the richest in my eyes, and they have all the wealth in the world. The experiences, the wisdom, the lessons, and the hunger - they have all the wealth that the world could offer. What else is wealth ? To me, we are not the numbers in your bank account, or the labels we have, but instead the stories that we have to share. Before leaving, Nurdin said &ldquo;Many people get everything very easily in Life, but it gets interesting when you have a story of struggles in life and how you overcome them. That can inspire future generations&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On hearing these words, my mind, heart and soul was replenished and left me smiling.</p>
<p>Nurdin inspired me. Who inspires you ?</p>
