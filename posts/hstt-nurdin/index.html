        <p>On a journey from Ljubljana to Genova, I found myself pausing in Milano Lampugnano, a nexus for weary travelers. Despite the physical drain of my journey, a blend of the enchanting solos of Greta Van Fleet and my own introspective mood left me in a state of unexpected elation. As the chill of the evening began to settle, I sought the comforting embrace of a hot ‘panino’ and freshly brewed coffee.</p>
<p>A few meters away, a man, resplendent in a bright red jacket, exuded an aura of tranquility. It wasn’t just his calm demeanor but something deeper, as if his soul had been sculpted by experiences both harrowing and enlightening. Drawn to him, our conversation began, fluidly oscillating between Italian and English. He introduced himself as Nurdin, a resilient spirit hailing from Ghana. Since 2013, he had forged a path through Italy and now, in a turn of serendipity, found himself employed at a bicycle shop in Germany.</p>
<p>As the night deepened, so did our dialogue. With gentle prodding, Nurdin began to share his heart-wrenching odyssey. Behind his calm demeanor lay tales of familial strife in Ghana that culminated in the tragic loss of his father. Sensing the looming shadows of peril, Nurdin embarked on an escape that took him to post-civil war Libya in 2011. From this tumultuous land, he faced the daunting vastness of the Mediterranean aboard a grievously overloaded inflatable boat. This perilous voyage, rife with uncertainty, was borne out of an unyielding hope and an indomitable spirit. From finding refuge in a Milanese camp to carving out a semblance of stability in a German town, Nurdin&rsquo;s journey was a tapestry of challenges met with unparalleled resilience.</p>
<p>Throughout this narrative, I found myself reflecting on my own voyages. As Nurdin’s tale unraveled, I couldn’t help but draw parallels with my own experiences — most notably, the profound sorrow of losing my father in 2020, and my unwavering resolve and purpose to give back to my mother for all what she has done for me. I had a profound realization here: It is often the unsung heroes, the everyday Nurdins, who carry the weightiest lessons. They compel us to redefine what true wealth is. For me, it isn&rsquo;t about material accumulation but rather the wealth of one&rsquo;s experiences, the stories we carry, and the insights we glean. As our conversation drew to a close, Nurdin, with the wisdom of someone who had truly lived, mused, &ldquo;The narratives of hardships faced and surmounted are the ones that truly have the power to inspire, to mold, and to illuminate future generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I left that night with Nurdin&rsquo;s indomitable spirit echoing in my soul. His resilience inspired me, and I pose this to you: Who inspires you?</p>
