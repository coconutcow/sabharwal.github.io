        <p>Italy was a pure accident. After having spent a good number of years working in the corporate space with some amazing minds, I had a strong sense of wanting to learn more and improve in some emerging areas such as machine learning. Before leaving a lucrative career, I wanted to be sure that my next jump would help me complete the objective of having a holistic understanding of technology and the underlying mathematics of these algorithms, frameworks, and methodologies.</p>
<p>I was hesitant to spend a large sum of money on educating myself, and instead began applying for scholarships in institutions that had a good faculty. To my surprise, I got accepted, with a &ldquo;near&rdquo; full scholarship (food, stay, tuition, all taken care of) to a program that had the same faculty teaching machine learning at MIT. I couldn&rsquo;t say no, and had the opportunity to learn under some of the best minds in Machine Learning, Computer vision and Data science.</p>
<p>One thing lead to another, and this country grew on me. I came here to learn and eventually leave for other opportunities, but the country had me fall in love. I often say that Indians and Italians have three things in common, which are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Love for Food</li>
<li>Love for Friends</li>
<li>Love for Family</li>
</ol>
<p>Gregory Roberts in his book &lsquo;Shantaram&rsquo; very eloquently put it that Indians are the Italians of Asia, and Italians are the Indians of Europe - I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. I thought I would only make acquaintances, but the land (made by its people) absorbed me, and I ended up with my own set of people, who I now call family.</p>
