        <p>Italy, for me, was serendipity. I had immersed myself in the corporate labyrinth for years, working alongside brilliant minds, but an itch remained. It wasn’t merely about advancing my career; I craved a profound comprehension of modern technology—particularly the intricate mathematics driving algorithms, frameworks, and methodologies of machine learning.</p>
<p>Before trading in a promising career trajectory, I sought assurance. I yearned for enlightenment without the weight of debt, and thus, aimed at scholarships from esteemed institutions. Fortune favored my audacity. I was bestowed a near-complete scholarship to a program led by faculty who also graced MIT&rsquo;s corridors teaching machine learning, computer vision, and data science. The decision was clear and swift.</p>
<p>Yet, what I hadn&rsquo;t anticipated was Italy&rsquo;s magnetic allure. Originally, I envisioned a brief sojourn; acquire knowledge and then seek horizons anew. But Italy, with its spirited culture and heartwarming hospitality, captivated me. An uncanny resemblance struck me: Indians and Italians share a passionate trilogy - food, friends, and family. Gregory Roberts in &lsquo;Shantaram&rsquo; beautifully quipped, &ldquo;Indians are the Italians of Asia, and Italians are the Indians of Europe.&rdquo; I resonate with this sentiment profoundly.</p>
<p>What I once assumed would be fleeting associations, transformed. The land and its people embraced me, and what was once foreign became familial. Today, in Italy, I’ve discovered more than just academic enlightenment; I&rsquo;ve found a second family.</p>
