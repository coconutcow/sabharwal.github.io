Hello there, I&rsquo;m San! Welcome to my little space where I digitally stitch my thoughts, experiences, and ideas together (<a href="/posts">posts</a>). When I am often asked &rsquo;tell me more about you&rsquo; - I have a story to share. Depending on who I am speaking with and the time constraints, I try to take the listener through my short lived experience, that we all call Life. With the energy one exhibits, you can tell how deep, far, and wide should your story be. This website is for those with an immense amount of patience, and who would genuinely want to get a glimpse of me - slow and steady.</p>
