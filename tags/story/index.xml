      <description>Italy was a pure accident. After having spent a good number of years working in the corporate space with some amazing minds at Deloitte, I had a strong sense of not having the depth and understanding of some emerging technologies such as machine learning, and felt the need to clear this unawareness.</description>

      <description>How I met Mary ?
This goes back to the 17th of September 2018 - my second day in Italy. I stepped out of my hostel room, and based on recommendations stepped out to get my tax code (codice fiscale) made. Having known just two Italian words (ciao and buongiorno), I thought that the best way to go and get this made would be to first search on google the office where this could be done.</description>
